## **Design**

I have opted for minimalist design focused on user interactivity. The user has the ability to switch between Light and Dark modes with the help of the suggestive switch that is always accessible on the Navbar.
The webapp was designed with a mobile-first approach using BootStrap grid for elements to re-arrange based on screen size. 
The Navbar was also built using BootStrap and collapses on small devices remaining fixed on top of the screen for easy access to the color theme switcher and links.

### **Font Scheme**

Font Scheme is comprised of the fonts from the Ubuntu Family for titles, Oxygen Family for information of focus and Fira Sans for general text. These fonts were chosen using Google Fonts as they compliment each other.
